# Projet-LSTM-Keras-C--
This project is a company research project that I created when I worked on forecasting stocks of client products (in the retail sector).  

It shows the different iterations of the notebooks I used, the last one being LTSM_test_8_production_perf. 
The trained networked obtained were tested by the company and outclassed their existing predictions models.
